- 👋 Hi, I’m @aut0exec
- 👀 I’m interested in cyber security, penetration testing, Linux, Networking, Perl, Bash, C, vulnerability research, reverse engineering, hardware hacking. If it's runs on 1's and 0's I'm probably interested in it! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything I can but specifically working on PNPT from TCM.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Perl projects to continue to become better with the language or anything else that peaks the interest!
