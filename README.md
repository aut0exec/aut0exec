- 👋 Hi, I’m @aut0exec
- 👀 I’m interested in cyber security, penetration testing, Linux, Networking, Perl, Bash, C, vulnerability research, reverse engineering, hardware hacking, network infrastructure services. If it runs on 1's and 0's I'm probably interested in it! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything I can but currently working on the OSCP and PJMR.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Perl projects to continue to become better with the language or anything else that peaks the interest!
